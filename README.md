## 📖 About the Project
This assignment is part of the **Machine Learning course** and focuses on applying key ML algorithms and concepts. The notebook includes:  

- Data preprocessing & cleaning  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations  
- Implementation of multiple ML algorithms  
- Model comparison using evaluation metrics  
- Insights and conclusions  

The goal is to build a strong foundation in **supervised & unsupervised learning techniques**, ensuring clear understanding of theory and practice.  


## 📂 Dataset
- **Source**: *[Add dataset source or mention if provided in course]*  
- **Format**: CSV / TXT / Inbuilt Scikit-learn dataset  
- **Attributes**: Features include `[feature1, feature2, ..., label]`  
- **Size**: Approximately `N rows × M columns`  



## 🚀 Features Implemented
- ✔️ Data preprocessing (handling missing values, normalization, encoding)  
- ✔️ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with plots & statistics  
- ✔️ Implementation of **classification/regression models**  
- ✔️ Training & evaluation with accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, etc.  
- ✔️ Model comparison and result visualization  
- ✔️ Well-documented Jupyter Notebook for reproducibility
